# Image-Captioning-to-Speech-Generation
This project develops a web app integrating image captioning and text-to-speech features. Using CNNs for image feature extraction and GRUs for generating captions, users can upload images via a Streamlit interface. Captions are created and converted into speech using gTTS, providing a tool for visually impaired users and image-to-text conversion.
